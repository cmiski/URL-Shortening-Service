docker-compose.yml is a config file for docker compose to define and run multi container docker applications (kinda like a blueprint that tells docker how to build and run the application)
  every container(service) can talk to each other uisng service name

  "docker compose up -d" --> starts all containers
  "docker compose ps" --> displays all running containers
  "docker composr logs" --> displays all logs
  "docker compose down": stops all containers, but leaves volumes intact
  "docker compose down -v": stops all containers and removes all volumes

  "docker exec -it <container name> redis-cli" --> to access redis cli
  "docker exec -it <container name> redis-cli ping" --> to check if redis is running
  "docker exec -it <container name> rpk cluster info" --> to check if redpanda is running

  my yml file is a optimezed setup for backend systems, event-driven architecture, Caching + DB + Streaming, microservices etc
    refer docker-compose.yml for details

  PHASE 1: CORE REDIRECT ENGINE (performance critical)
    --> this defines the latency discipline for the entire project
